# About this Website

I created this website during a bootcamp in 2016 and am trying to keep the content up to date. Since it is a very common layout and quite easy to maintain, I recommend you to fork it and make your own version of it for your own portfolio. I am deploying the code to netlify for free and can recommend this as well since they have an integration with Github and for deploying you basically just have to merge to your main branch.

If you want to see it in your browser, visit [kaja.netlify.app](https://kaja.netlify.app/)

## The Structure

This website is structured as a single page with link hooks that you can scroll down to. At the top there is a simple navigation bar.

Underneath is a big image caroussel to invite the visitor in with nice images. When you scroll further down, you can find the following sections:
* Bootstrap columns about career goals, projects etc.
* My work section with screenshots of my earliest projects.
* About Kaja section with some text tiles about myself.
* My story section with a little summery about my life.
* Contact section with a contact form where you can leave me a message.
* FAQ section with a simple drop down menue.
* A CV link button to my CV as a PDF.
* Video section with videos about my conference talks and my favorite surf video.
* A footer with my twitter handle.
